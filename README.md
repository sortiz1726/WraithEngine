# WraithEngine
this is my personal 3D game engine written in C++. 
This project also contains assets used for a game Tank Game I created to demonstrate the engines capabilites.

# Features

Scenes provide a place to instantiate user Game Objects and Game Objects contain various services for update, draw, alarm, input, and collision callbacks
