# WraithEngine
this is my personal 3D game engine written in C++. 
This project also contains assets used for a game Tank Game I created to demonstrate the engines capabilites.

# Features
The engine provides **Scene** and **Game Objects** class for users to use to create their own their own custom game.
Scenes provide a place to instantiate user Game Objects and Game Objects contain various services for update, draw, alarm, input, and collision callbacks
